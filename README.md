# weatherForecast

This website uses React, React Router, and Moment.js to display a weather forecast for the current day in additional to the following week. The development is primarily for my own developmental and educational purposes.

Open Weather API requires an API key. This is stored in .env as REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY.
