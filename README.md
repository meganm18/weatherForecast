# weatherForecast

This website uses React.js to display a weather forecast for the current day in additional to the following week. The development is primarily for my own developmental and educational purposes.

# Running the Project

Open Weather API requires an API key. This is stored in .env as REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY.


To run locally, navigate to the directory in terminal.

Run in terminal:
`npm start`
